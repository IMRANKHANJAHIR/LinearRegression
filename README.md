# 🏠 Task 3: Linear Regression – Housing Price Prediction

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship. The goal is to implement and understand both simple and multiple linear regression using a real-world dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Use Linear Regression to predict housing prices.
- Learn how to evaluate regression models.
- Interpret model coefficients and performance metrics.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)
- **Note**: You need to download the dataset manually from the Kaggle link above and save it as `Housing.csv` in your project folder.
